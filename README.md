### Environment variables in Expo

https://docs.expo.dev/guides/environment-variables/

- The Expo CLI will automatically load environment variables with an `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix from .env
  files for use within your JavaScript code.

- Do not store sensitive info, such as private keys, in `EXPO_PUBLIC_` variables. These variables
  will be visible in plain-text in your compiled application.
